# SimpleThermostat
Arduino Library for handling a simple thermostat with cooling and heating functions, compatible with DHT11, DHT22 and DS18B20 temperature sensors.
More info on features, prerequisites and library usage in the [Simple Thermostat Wiki](https://github.com/EPMatt/SimpleThermostat/wiki).

This library uses code from [OneWire library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html) and Rob Tillaart's [DHTStable library](https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTstable). Make sure to download and put them in your libraries folder.
